	Show:
	$$ e^{xA}Be^{-xA} = \sum \frac{x^k}{x!} \ad_{A}^k (B),$$
	where $\ad$ is defined as: $\ad_a(b) = [a,b]$.

	\p Show that center of  $SO(n)$ either trivial, or has order 2. What is the center of $SU(n)$?.

	\p
	Let us introduce metric on $SU(2)$:

	Show that it corresponds with standard sphere metric.
