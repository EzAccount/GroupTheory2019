	\p
	Find transposition representation of $S_3$.
	\ep
	\p
	Decompose transposition representation of $S_3$ to direct sum of representations.
	\ep
	\p 
	Let $G$ be a cyclic group. Find all irreducible representations of $G$.
	\ep
	\p 
   Show that if  representation $\phi$ is one-dimensional, then commutant $[G,G]$ lies in the kernel of representation.
	\ep
	\p
	Construct any representation of $S_4$. Which symmetry it describes? Find its character.
	\ep
	\p Consider any other $S_4$ symmetry. Find the character of the corresponding representation.
	\ep

	
	\p Find all 1-dimensional representations of $S_n$
	\ep
	\p Write tables of characters for $S_4$
	\ep
	\p Show that for finite group $G$ the amount of irreducible  non-equivalent by pairs complex representations is equal to the amount of conjugacy classes.
