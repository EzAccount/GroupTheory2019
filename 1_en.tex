	Show, that any permutation can be represented
	\begin{itemize}
	\item as a product of permutations of the form $(1,i)$;
	\item as a product of permutations of the form $(i, i+1)$.
\end{itemize}
	\ep
	\df
	$\s(\pi)=(-1)^t$, where t is the amount of transpositions in $\pi$ 
	\edf
	\p
	Show that  $\s$ doesn't depend on product decomposition. Formulate the definition of $\s$ based on amount of inversion in permutation. 
	\ep
	\p
   	Show that $\s: S_n \to \Z_2$ is an homomorphism
	\ep


	\p 
	Prove that the following are isomorphism:
	\begin{align*}
	S_3 &\simeq \text{[Equilateral triangle symmetry group]} \\
	S_4 &\simeq \text{[Cube rotations group]}\\
	S_4 \times S_2 &\simeq{\text{[Cube symmetry group]}}
	\end{align*}

	\p Prove that the group of 6 element is either abelian or isomorphic to $S_3$
	\ep
	
	\df Let $f$ be isomorphism $G \to G$. Then $f$ is called an automorphism of $G$. Group of some group's $G$ automorphisms is denoted as $\Aut G$.
	\edf

	\p Show, that
	$\Aut(\Z_p) \simeq (\Z_p)$
	\ep
	
	\p Show that any infinite group has a non-trivial subgroup.
	\ep
	
	\p Show that any group of order 8 has the following form: $\{1,a, a^2, a^3, b, ab, a^2 b, a^3 b\}$. 
	\ep
	
	\p 
	Which is greater: number of elements of $S_n$ of odd order or of even order?
	\ep

	\p
	Let  $G$ be a set with a following binary operation  $/$:
	$$
		G \times G \to G: (g,h) \mapsto g/h
	$$
	$$
	\forall f,g,h \in G: (f/h)/(g/h) = f/g
	$$
	$$
	\forall g,h \in G, \exists x \in G: g/x=h
	$$
   Show, that $G$ is group with respect to the following product: $gh = g/ ((h/h)/h)$.
